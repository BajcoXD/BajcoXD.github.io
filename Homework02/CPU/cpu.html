      AMD and Intel are the top competitors in the CPU market, each with unique
      strengths. AMD CPUs are known for high core counts, making them excellent
      for multitasking, video editing, and gaming at competitive prices. AMD's
      Ryzen series, especially with Zen 3 and Zen 4 architectures, offers great
      performance-per-dollar value, particularly with multi-core workloads.
      Intel CPUs, on the other hand, have historically excelled in single-core
      performance, which benefits applications that rely on fewer cores, like
      certain games. Intel's latest Core series also brings impressive power
      efficiency and overclocking capabilities.

      Choosing between AMD and Intel depends on your needs: if you focus on
      heavy multitasking or productivity, AMD is often the best choice. For
      gaming or applications favoring higher clock speeds, Intel may provide
      better performance. Both brands offer reliable options for different
      budgets.
