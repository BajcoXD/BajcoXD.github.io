      NVIDIA and AMD are two leading brands in the graphics processing unit
      (GPU) market, each offering unique strengths. NVIDIA is known for its
      advanced ray tracing capabilities and DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling),
      which enhance performance and visuals in high-resolution gaming. Their
      GPUs tend to excel in tasks like 3D rendering, AI workloads, and
      professional video editing, due to their CUDA cores and AI integration.
      AMD GPUs, on the other hand, provide solid gaming performance with their
      RDNA architecture and competitive pricing, often delivering better value
      for money, especially at midrange levels. AMDâ€™s GPUs also offer FidelityFX
      Super Resolution (FSR) for upscaling.

      If you prioritize productivity, NVIDIA might be better. For gaming on a
      budget, AMD GPUs could be more cost-effective without sacrificing quality.
